    <h1>For anyone interested in my corporate background</h1>
<hr/>
    <p>
        I am an offer holder for UCL's new innovative course (BSc Information
        in Society). I am really interested in pursuing opportunities for banking
        and consulting. A highly motivated and analytical individual with a keen 
        interest in pursuing a career in banking or management consulting. Equipped 
        with strong quantitative skills from studying Mathematics and Economics at A-Level, 
        complemented by hands-on experience in data analysis roles at the UK Health Security 
        Agency and FactSet. Adept at quickly grasping new technologies, as demonstrated by 
        self-studying A-Level Psychology and rapidly adapting to working with various CRMs 
        and software systems across multiple internships.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Beyond academics, I have honed my problem-solving abilities through entrepreneurial 
        ventures like co-founding an e-commerce business during the pandemic. I thrive in 
        fast-paced environments that demand exceptional organizational skills and the ability 
        to juggle multiple tasks efficiently. With a natural aptitude for building rapport 
        and developing trust, I excel in client-facing roles that require strong communication 
        abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seeking an opportunity in banking or consulting to leverage my analytical mindset, 
        technical proficiency, and customer service experience to drive impactful solutions for 
        businesses. I am a dedicated team player committed to continuous learning and professional 
        growth.
