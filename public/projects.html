    <h1>Projects</h1>
<hr/>
    <p>
        This page will contain any projects that I have done in the past
        and there will be screenshots of some of the projects to give a 
        glimpse of what the outcomes of the code are. I am trying to grow
        as a programmer, so the projects aren't advanced (yet). I would
        appreciate any feedback via an email as I do want to grow and 
        break into the technology industry.
