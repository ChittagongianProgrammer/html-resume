  <h1>For anyone interested in my tech background</h1>
<hr/>
  <p>
    I am an offer holder for UCL's new innovative course (BSc Information
    in Society). This made me take the intiative to look at the first year
    modules to see what I will be learning and see if I can take the intiative
    to learn or revise certain things like web development or data analytics
    before I start in September.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I mentioned, I am trying to keep programming fresh in my mind so I
    am ready for September. I had experience in: web development, software 
    engineering, data analytics, game development, electronics and cyber security.
    I made this section seperate as I will be intending to use this website for not
    only technical roles as I will be working before and during university 
    in internships or non-career related roles to save money for my tuition fees.
    Therefore, I will be adding my projects to this section for anyone interested
    in learning about my passion for technology rather than my passion for 
    anything outside of technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will be including my projects here as I do not want to make it hard for 
    a potential client or employer to find my projects. If the layout of this 
    page isn't good for displaying my projects, I would appreciate feedback via 
    sending an email to me. My email can be found on the front page.
